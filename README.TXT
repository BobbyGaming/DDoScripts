These scripts have been purchased off of a dark web marketplace. They have been posted here on GitHub so people do not have to risk leaking their data on the dark web.

There are many scripts, most are written in python but there are pearl, c and .rar executables as well. Each script is basic and straight-forward to use. They are all made to run in a terminal session and not inside of an IDE.

Be carefull with how you use the scripts and try to avoid legal trouble, enjoy.
